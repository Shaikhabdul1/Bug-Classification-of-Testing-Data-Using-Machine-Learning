# Bug Classification of Testing Data Using Machine Learning

This project explores ML-based approaches for classifying software bugs using Neural Networks, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Logistic Regression. The goal was to improve bug detection efficiency and support software testing teams.

### 🔍 Techniques
- Data preprocessing (Python)
- Feature engineering
- Supervised ML (RF, GB, LR, NN)
- Classification performance evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, AUC)

### 📊 Results
Machine learning models demonstrated improved detection capability over classical/manual testing processes.

### 🛠 Tools
Python · Scikit-Learn · Pandas · NumPy · Power BI · Jupyter

### 📂 Files
- Notebook
- Data
- Report
